Custom Sections is a WordPress plugin that gives you an alternative to the default Widgets

== Description ==

Custom Sections is a WordPress plugin that gives you an alternative to the default Widgets. Custom Sections are pieces of content to be used as shortcode or directly in your theme.

To use custom template files for sections, files must be named section-templatename.php

== Installation ==

1. Upload the folder `custom-sections` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to Settings -> Custom Sections to configure the custom post type to be used as section.

The custom post type can optionaly be created by the user in the functions.php, or via a plugin that can create custom post types without programming.
